# Motor Mounting

Problems arose during this step of the process, so here are the highlights of each considered mounting method.

## Direct Contact

This was the original plan: to use a small wheel on the motor to directly touch the tire. It was assumed that a spring could provide an incredible amount of clamping force and thus friction, however, it proved difficult to solidly mount the motor. Because of this, it was hard to control the clamping force. The speficic combination of motor and controller means that the motor does not start as gradually as anticipated; it jumps up to a high speed. Without enogh friction, the motor spun without turning the tire; in fact, it burned a small hole in the tire's sidewall, destroying it.

## Chain Drive

A sprocket would be mounted on the motor and another on the tire spokes, using a chain between them. This would provide a solid, mechanical connection between motor and tire, and the motor can be mounted away from the pedals where there is more space. This method has not yet been tested because the gear ratios would be wrong (the original motor was specifically chosen because of an over 60 times torque multiplication), but a much smaller sprocket would have to be mounted on the wheel (ie, not as big as the tire itself). This would result in a much lower torque multiplication. This method is used by some gasoline engine conversion kits so it is proven to work in the field, but not yet with this specific setup.

## Existing Chain Drive

Another option currently being pursued: adding another chain to drive the existing gear train. The motor would drive the crankeset (gear the pedals connect to), which would then drive the rear tire through the normal bike gearing. The big disadvantage is that the pedals will always spin when the motor turns, which is not great if the rider simply wanted to ride the bike like a motorcycle and not engage their feet.

## Direct Spoke Drive

This is a final method, explored simply because if is similar to the simplicty of the direct contact method except it does not rely on friction. A special gear would be made to mount on the motor, which would in turn engage the spokes. The advantage is its simplicity: a prototype gear was made out of wood, and the motor does not need an additional chain and tensioning device, like the chain methods. However, it proved difficult to correctly cut the gear geometry and the gear ratio is quite poor. Finally, the spokes are strongest at the tip (closest to the wheel), but this method would require one spoke to be under the full drive force at a time, which would probably cause the spokes to fail. Plus, a wood gear is likely to chip or wear away faster than a metal one.
