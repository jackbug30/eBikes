# Motor Mounting

The motor mounting, quite an important step. This is where I really ran into trouble with the project, so here are the highlights of the different methods I tried.

## Direct Contact

This was my original plan: to use a small wheel on the motor to directly touch the wheel. I thought it would be possible to use a spring and provide an incredible amount of force to hold it on the wheel and keep lots of friction, to prevent slipping. However, it proved quite difficult to 1. mount the motor solidly, and 2. provide that much clamping force. My first test resulted in a destroyed tire sidewall.

## Chain Drive

This was a theoretical option, and my preferred had I not already bought parts. I would build a gear drive to directly drive the rear wheel. This method is already used by some kits. The problem is that my specific motor would not provide enough torque to drive the bike fast enough.

## Existing Chain Drive

Another option I am currently pursuing. Adding another chain to drive the existing gear train. The advantage is that we retain the shifting capabilites, although frankly I don't think this would help a whole lot. Also, the pedals must spin as the motor does, meaning I can't truly relax my legs and let the motor drive it like I wanted. Finally, my specific motor will not allow enough gear ratio.

## Direct Spoke Drive

This method is one I'm trying for the heck of it, although I doubt it will properly work. Using a gear I made out of wood, I will drive the spokes. The nice thing is that it doesn't require a lot of fabrication like some of the other methods, and we retain the solid, mechanical link like a chain without the possibility of slipping like the direct contact method. The problem, again, is the gear ratio and lining everything up.
