# Final Assembly

FInally, final assembly.

## Battery Mounting

I chose to mount two small lead acid batteries in the front frame. I used large hose clamps to clamp, with rubber tape to prevent slipping.

## ESC Mounting

The ESC is just mounted near the motor.

## Throttle Mounting

The throttle is currently just a servo controller, but I plan to build a better one eventually. It is zip tied to the handlebars.

## Wiring

The batteries are connected to the speed controller via thick, 12 guage wire and crimp terminals. Wire is frequently zip tied to manage it. The wires from the throttle to ESC are thinner wires I soldered.
