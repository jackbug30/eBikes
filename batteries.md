# Battery Selection

There are lots of battery choices, so I weighed the pros and cons of some of my options.

## Lead Acid

Lead Acid batteries are simple, in fact most car batteries are lead acid. They commonly come as sealed, maintenance free batteries, which are really nice. They are already in a hard plastic case, can be mounted in any orientation, and are easy to charge with a simple off the shelf charger.

On the negative, they aren't super power dense. You need quite a bit of lead acid battery to hold the same amount of power as some other options. Also, if they get damaged, they are full of liquid battery acid.

## Lithium

Lithium batteries are great because they pack so much power into a tight package. However, that's where my pros end.

They are much more difficult to charge than lead acid: to do it properly, each cell needs to be balance charged. This means a big, slow, specialized charger. Also, they are really dangerous. They don't come in a hard shell like lead acid, so if they are punctured, they explode or at light light on fire. A really bad idea for a bike which may crash.

## NiCd

This is another option. They have similar density to lead acid.

However, they commonly come in small cells that would have to be wired together. They also need special chargers, and may develop a memory where they lose capacity over time if improperly used.

## Decision: lead acid

At least for the prototype. I like the realative safety and robustness of lead acid batteries.

## Voltage

I decided on 12v batteries. This is in part because my motor would run fine at 12v, and the wiring at that voltage is simple enough.
