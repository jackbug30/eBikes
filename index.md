# Building Your Own Electric Bicycle

This is a DIY project to upgrade a normal bicycle to an electric one in an inexpensive and simple way. It follows the progress and various approaches used to design an e-bike in the hope that others can gain useful info from it.

## Audience

This site is not a tutorial or walkthrough with exact building steps and shopping lists. Instead, it follows the design process and reasoning behind different things. It is intended for an audience with a reasonable DIY background, i.e., being comfortable using hand tools and very basic metal work (cutting small pieces of metal, drilling holes, etc), and understanding at least a little bit about low voltage wiring. That said, it dives into some physics and electrical design so no deep understanding of those is expected prior to reading.

## Contents

This site is organized into several pages, each going over a different topic. Again, this is meant as a high level overview, so it is recommended to read the entire site before you start so you have a full plan from the beginning.

1. Home-This page. Basic overview of project.
2. [Motor size](motor)-Physics behind motor selection and speed controller.
3. [Batteries](batteries)-Weighing different battery options.
4. [Motor mounting](motor-mount)-How the motor is mounted to the bike and drivetrain.
5. [Final assembly](final-assembly)-Battery mounting/final wiring
