# Building Your Own Electric Bicycle

This is a project of mine to upgrade a normal bicycle to an electric one in an inexspensive and simple way. It follows my progress and various approaches I took to design an e-bike and I hope that others can get useful info from it.

## Audience

This site is not a tutorial or walkthrough with exact building steps and shopping lists. Instead, it follows my design process and reasoning behind different things. I intend for people with a reasonable DIY background to be interested, i.e., being comfortable using hand tools and very basic metal work (cutting small pieces of metal, drilling holes, etc), and understanding at least a little bit about low voltage wiring. That said, I do not expect everyone to understand the full electrical design and physics I used, so I go into detail about those.
