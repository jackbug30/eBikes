# Building Your Own Electric Bicycle

This is a project of mine to upgrade a normal bicycle to an electric one in an inexspensive and simple way. It follows my progress and various approaches I took to design an e-bike and I hope that others can get useful info from it.

## Audience

This site is not a tutorial or walkthrough with exact building steps and shopping lists. Instead, it follows my design process and reasoning behind different things. I intend for people with a reasonable DIY background to be interested, i.e., being comfortable using hand tools and very basic metal work (cutting small pieces of metal, drilling holes, etc), and understanding at least a little bit about low voltage wiring. That said, I do not expect everyone to understand the full electrical design and physics I used, so I go into detail about those.

## Contents

This site is organized into several pages, each going over a different topic. Again, this is meant as a high level overview, so if you truly intend to build your own bike, read the entire thing before you start because it might change how you proceed from the beginning.

1. [Index](index)-This page. Basic overview of project.
2. [Motor size](motor)-Physics behind motor selection and speed controller.
3. [Batteries](batteries)-Weighing different battery options.
4. [Motor mounting](motor-mount)-How the motor is mounted to the bike and drivetrain.
5. [Final assembly](final-assembly)-Battery mounting/final wiring
